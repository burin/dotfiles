# dotfiles

There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## Usage

From the command-line, clone this project:

    mkdir -p ~/Projects
    xcode-select --install
    git clone https://github.com/moubry/dotfiles.git ~/Projects/dotfiles

Install Homebrew:
    
    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Make sure it's working:

    brew doctor

Install Brewdler:

    brew tap Homebrew/brewdler

Install system dependencies with Brewdler:

    cd ~/Projects/dotfiles
    brew brewdle

Setup the dotfiles:

    ~/Projects/dotfiles/bootstrap.sh

##### Youâ€™re done!

Check out the new apps you have installed:

    find ~/Applications -cmin -60

Try [one of the cool aliases](https://github.com/moubry/dotfiles/blob/master/dotfiles/bash/updaters):

    update

## Configuring OS X

This command will close a bunch of your apps, including Terminal. So do this at the end:

    . ~/Projects/dotfiles/.osx

Other things to remember that the `.osx` script doesn't handle for you:

* Terminal > Preferences > Profiles > Keyboard > Use Option as Meta key
* System Preferences > Trackpad > Check every single box in every section
* Open DropBox and sign in > Choose folders to sync > Start unchecking everything except:
  * 1Password
  * Apps
  * Public
  * Temp
  * TextExpander
* Wait until all Dropbox files are downloaded (this'll take about 10 minutes)
* Configure all the software that requires licenses
